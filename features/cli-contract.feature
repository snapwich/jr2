Feature: The CLI contract
  Cross-cutting guarantees a user's shell relies on: exit codes that mean something. Each Rule runs
  against its own isolated instance.

  Rule: errors map to exit codes
    0 ok, 1 runtime error, 2 usage — so scripts can branch on `$?`.

    Scenario: a run-control verb with no orchestrator exits 1
      Given a fresh instance
      When I list the runs
      Then the command exits 1
      And stderr reports an error

    Scenario: an unknown command exits 2
      When I run an unknown command
      Then the command exits 2
      And stderr reports an unknown command
