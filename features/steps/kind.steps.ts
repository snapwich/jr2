// Steps for the @kind tier: assertions that reach past the orchestrator into the REAL cluster.
// Everything here is observed the way a user would — `kubectl` for the cluster, the `j2` binary
// for the run — so the tier stays black-box (ADR-0010). Reading run status reuses the mechanics
// -tier steps; only the cluster-facing claims live here.
//
// The Sandbox is found by its `j2.dev/run` LABEL, never by reconstructing its name: that label is
// the run↔workspace link ADR-0012 promises (what `j2 ls` will group by), so looking it up this way
// asserts the promise instead of trusting the naming function.
//
// NOTHING HERE PLAYS THE AGENT (ADR-0013), and since ADR-0038 the reason has inverted. The pod
// runs the REAL `@j2/harness`: it holds its own MCP connection to the Adapter on localhost, is
// served this state's Menu, and pi decides. What this file drives is the one thing still faked —
// the MODEL. "The Agent calls X" RELEASES the provider request this pod's Harness is parked on,
// answering it with a tool call; everything after that (the MCP call, the delivery, the Machine
// moving) happens inside the cluster. If this file opened an MCP client, the pod would never
// originate a connection and the leg under test would not be tested.
